## Getting Started
Hi this is armando, and am going to be presenting this project.


This is a site i 
also wanted to do for myselft
is about cooking so
if you go throught the page
and click any of the recipes
you see you may be able to see
more details about it
maybe a video a description
or some tools that may help you breaking throught it.

Once nice thing about the features of this page is not is not using anything like bootstrap, its made using my own single hand scss wich allows me have a particular amount of options
i do like to have around.

Some of the features i this page have in it, is that i can filter either using the search input in the begining of the page or using the popular categories so it will send you
there using the same page.

Also this site allows you clicking recipes go inside and check for details thought is not using any interface at the moment, it has a lot of qualities that can give a good experience 
once you give it space to style.

So the data is requested each time when the user gets in to the home page, 
the app will always load that view since it is good to keep it updated, 
when comes about the details page
the data will always keep there for about 60 seconds, after 15 seconds the app wont hydrate none of the details of it.

This apps manages to update and persist information using redux so all the information is centralized using components and containers. this is important 
since redux itself has along anothers libraries you can use with like redux-persist and from then make your own expiration tickets.
